# First-Project
My first official project on EDA and GitHub practice.
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset using statistical methods and applying machine learning models to uncover insights.
The work covers descriptive analysis, visualization, regression, and clustering techniques, showcasing a complete workflow from exploration to prediction.

Features:
✅ Performed data cleaning & preprocessing

✅ Generated descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance)

✅ Created data visualizations for better insights

✅ Implemented a Linear Regression model for predictions

✅ Applied Clustering (KMeans) for grouping similar patterns

✅ Exported results for reproducibility

Tech Stack:
Python,
Pandas, NumPy,
Matplotlib, Seaborn,
Scikit-learn
